## Transaction Types

**BGC – Bank Giro Credit**
Money coming in that was paid in over the counter / via a credit slip (often a cash or cheque deposit). 

**DD – Direct Debit**
A company pulls money from your account under a mandate you set up (bills, subs, charities…). Amount and date are usually controlled by the company. 

**DEB – Debit card transaction**
You paid with your card (chip & PIN, contactless, sometimes online) and it’s posted as a card debit. 

**FPI – Faster Payment Incoming**
A bank transfer to you — someone (or you, from another account) sent you money via Faster Payments. Near-instant. 

**FPO – Faster Payment Outgoing**
A bank transfer from you to someone else, via Faster Payments. Also near-instant. 

**SO – Standing Order**
A fixed, regular payment you set up yourself (same amount/schedule unless you change it) — e.g. rent to landlord, savings to another account. Different from DD because you control it.
